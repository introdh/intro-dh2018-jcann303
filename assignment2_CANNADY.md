**Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.**
  For my analysis I chose the Civil Rights Commission (20040) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (10130). These cases dealt with the death penalty and desegregation of public places.  I think that establishing a network was a way to compare and link data in multiple ways and draw different conclusions for each idea. I selected two cases that dealt with humanity and the rights of people. While very different on the surface, the end goal for each remains a better quality of life for those involved. 

**Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data.**
  My data supports that winning a supreme court vote can change the overall outlook of society. In terms of desegregation, the supreme court chose to vote on something that many people were not yet progressive enough for. Now in 2018, while still dealing with racial tensions, all individuals in the United States are given opportunities and chances those before them may not have received. In terms of the death penalty in federal prisons, the question of how humane the process and choice is. Do we want prisoners to have that option? Do we want states to levy that kind of punishment? It is a very controversial topic just as it was a controversial case. 
  Both cases are questionably inhumane and demeaning in different ways. Civil rights movements were to gain equal rights regardless of color because everyone deserves it despite the nation's horrific past. The death penalty is viewed as cruel, extreme, and inhumane by many so it came into court to challenge if it was ethical. While both are wildly different in what they are trying to achieve in the long run, they are similar in the fact that they both wanted a more humane environment for everyone to live in. Each case in the supreme court is unique and provides answers and regulations for very difficult issues. Another notable point to think about is the year in which cases took place and the party majority that sat on the bench. This could be major in deciding many cases, because each political agenda is so different. 

**Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilities and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers.**

Networks are useful and can be used in a variety of ways, but should not be the only tool used. They show relationships and are made useful in the understanding of interlocking systems. The relationships are vital to the creation and overall understanding of the network (Weingart, JDH, 2012). This was supported in my data analysis when I was able to compare so many different variables between cases, like year, votes, issues, and centrality. The ability to understand relationships is a stength of the networking system when implemented effectively. A limitation of using networks is that they can make comparisons of more than one variable, like being bimodal, but cannot incorporate as many data points as strategies like using algorithms (Weingart, JDH, 2012). With my data, I would have to compare differnt variables between charts and make generalizations for each network then compare those generalizations. Other strategies account for more variables and can provide more information on more inclusive sets of data. Another limitation arises with data cutting. If data is being cut, it is possible that already biased data could become more skewed and unreliable. It becomes like an art to be able to appropriately manage and cut down a data set without compromising the integrity of the information within it . Time and focus have to be allocated to create an effective network, but when achieved there are numerous possibilities for the data. Basic data pieces influence heavily, but are so powerful to providing intuitive, interesting, and useful results (Weingart, JDH, 2012).
