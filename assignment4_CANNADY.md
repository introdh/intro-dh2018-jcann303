Award Level
	For this project, we are requesting level II funding ($50,001-100,000). This level of funding would be incredibly purposeful in this program as we strive to create free educational programs for students, especially those from low-income backgrounds. This program strives to especially integrate technology into the hands of the students and shape their futures, regardless of race, gender, or background. Hopefully this proposal will exhibit my program’s dedication to the cause that we have sought out to research and change. We are a quickly growing, high demand organization with great value to the programs that we have been granted the opportunity to work with. We wish that you will extend us the chance to continue forward in our mission with you r funding and support. 
Enhancing the Humanities 
Scope of project:
 Efforts have been made for years, yet there is still inequality present in the educational system. This program will particularly focus on allowing minority students, especially those with challenging socioeconomic backgrounds to receive new opportunities. These opportunities come in the forms of classes, educational camps, and workshops.  Project managers include professionals from varying backgrounds and disciplines that are collaborating to create the best curriculum and programs for our students to grow within. The initial goal will be to integrate our mission into one school, then over time spread to an entire school system, and beyond. Narrowing and eventually eliminating the achievement gap is the end goal of this project. The achievement, or education, gap is defined as differences in performance and opportunity of low-income or minority students when compared to their counterparts. It is seen that ethnic and low-income backgrounds traditionally score far below majority on standardized testing (“Students Affected”).  This project is in place to eliminate such gaps in our society and bridge each and every student closer together by any means possible. 
First, we started our journey in Potomac Waters Elementary School. The school met the socioeconomic features that we wished to assist and the faculty and staff was fully on board with the program. Twice a week, we are offering an expanse of classes and workshops to 3rd-5th graders during the schools remedial education period. The students sign up for and attend the seminars that capture their interests. We want for each and every child to get the opportunity to explore varying fields and capture their passion. With exposure to educational reform programs, students of all backgrounds will see that it is possible for them to tackle any future that they desire. We try to keep student interest with rotating courses, or recurring and expansive if there is a highly positive response coming forward. 
Research Questions: 
The question that this research and grant request seeks to answer is: do minority and low-income neighborhoods provide educational opportunities equal to those in as financially well-off or non-minority students? Educational outcomes for minority children are much more of a function of their unequal access to key resources, including skilled teachers and quality curriculum, than they are a function of race. In fact, the U.S. educational system is one of the most unequal in the industrialized world, and students routinely receive dramatically different learning opportunities based on their social status. Additional questions that have surfaced in the research of these topics are: what factors are the most contributory to the education and achievement gap in America? What are the differences in this type of training between public and private institutions? What are the main goals for reform in our public school system? 
Software Requirement
While this project focuses on the all-around educational needs of the student, one of the major implementations will be the introduction and emphasis on the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. These fields are incredibly lucrative and are essential for the development of the future. Almost all businesses, corporations, and fields of work are transitioning to a more technologically-based system that requires basic knowledge and competencies to operate. Allowing children to become more comfortable with the various types of technology and applications available will eventually make them more marketable and give them a better chance at employment. 
Environmental scan 
	There have been successful strategies enacted by other programs and institutions. One of these programs is McKinley Technology High School in Washington D.C. This school started as a poor performance school in a low-income neighborhood and eventually closed in 1997. The decision was made to reopen the school with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) focus. Smaller class sizes, higher quality teachers, and increased implementation of technology in the classroom were all tactics of the program. In a short period of time, McKinley was thriving as one of the top schools in the district (“Reducing the Gap”, Porter). The theme of implementing technology increases performance and can assist in reducing the achievement gap. 
	Another report has surfaced form the Alliance for Excellent Education and the Stanford Center for Opportunity and Policy in Education (SCOPE) found that technology can aid student achievement and boost overall engagement of students. This particular study found that when students of differing backgrounds are provided with the same opportunities, there is a decrease in the achievement gap and the overall success of low-income and disadvantaged students is much improved. The most difficult part of enacting this type of education and program is the lack of funding that many school systems have, and the inability to properly train teachers. If implemented correctly, this type of program has potential for great success (“Improve Learning”). 
	Digital Promise is a nonprofit that was authorized by Congress in 2008 as the National Center for Research in Advanced Information and Digital Technologies through Section 802 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act that was signed into law by President George W. Bush. This organization recognizes the huge gap that exists between the learning outcomes, graduation rates, and college readiness of students based on socioeconomic factors. There are gaps between school performance that is based on varying access to funding and resources. The vision of Digital Promise is that all people in all stages of their learning journey will have assistance to acquire the knowledge and skill set that they need in the continuously changing world (“Digital Promise”). One of their main goals is to lessen the Digital Learning Gap so that everyone can have equitable access to technology. 
	Additionally it is evident that there is a wide deal of programs prepared to provide funding for this type of research. The Baltimore Community Foundation accepts applications for grants, but is especially mindful of the necessity of racial equality. This foundation strives to create ready, effective education systems that will prepare students for the next phases in their lives. It is valuable to have smaller, independent groups ready to put grants forward to make a change in society (“Education Gaps”). There urgency for a strong educational system communicates passion. These are the types of organizations that contribute to the movements previously stated and movements like our own. 
	These programs are just a few of the many in place sharing a similar mission to our own. It is promising that the government has made strives to reduce the digital gap and equalize opportunity, but that was in 2008 and that simply shows the urgency for more programs to support this movement. This is a widespread problem that needs to be nurtured in one educational setting at a time. It cannot be forced widespread, it has to be properly funded and prepared for to increase the outcomes for all parties involved. This project will contribute tremendously to the advancement of this field. 

History of the project 
	Currently, our research has been reviewed and posted in two sociology journals and one educational journal. We are attempting to start holding small seminars. Our research only looked at three grade levels in one institution, so we are trying to decide what the next steps to take will be as we spread our influence to the entire school district. As far as other funding, the National Education Association Foundation has shown interest in our research. Our venture to make education more equalized for all involved is perfect for their mission. Further, our venture to integrate technology and humanities into the schools to introduce it to all ages with no cost is representative of your mission. 
	Finding a school interested in our data collection and integration of technology to all students was not difficult. We have created a very strong relationship with the staff at the school and have shaped good quality educators into great educators. As mentioned previously, we are working with the school board to integrate our programs into other schools in the area and to other age groups. Our project has so much to gain and so far to grow. We have followed in the footsteps of innovators before us, now it is our turn, and possibly yours, to place hope and equality in an education system that greatly needs it.

Work Plan
	During our time immersed in an educational program, each team member has specific tasks and duties that they undertake. In many cases, as director of the program I organize most of the fundraising, manage the staff, and connect with school programs that we are able to work in to. My co-chair John and our tech-expert Sara along with a small team integrate our new technologies into the schools when the students are away. At a later date, the two hold seminars to help the children learn how to utilize the new devices that will be shaping their learning experience. Our VP for Outreach Rick shoots email blasts and reminders to the kids about all of the experiences we have for them to immerse. Additionally, he runs a course for the program focusing on marketing and consumerism. Meghan is the organizer for all of the educator training. She has received the formal training for our program, now we trust her to share her knowledge and progress the program as she has thus far. Depending on the monetary sources we able to bring in from other sources 
The largest risk that we take is expanding to other age groups. Older or younger kids may not share the same excitement for this opportunity, in which case we would be spending money with little change. The whole goal is to create that equal learning environment that so many children have not gotten to see throughout their life. Also, this is to prepare them for a future in a field that they may not have had the opportunity to learn and experience without this program. Additionally, training educators rather than bringing in trained educators is a large risk. A concern is that an educator may not share excitement or take advantage of the potentials of this learning style. 
In the near future, our goal is to find more investors willing to give to our cause. Again, our goal is to be able to provide completely for every student that gets to be a part of our program. We want to provide the same exact opportunity to every child regardless of their background. With the continued interest of the schoolboard that we are currently interacting with continues to grow, it is only a matter of time until we spread. Spreading within our current school system is inevitable. There has also been urgency from surrounding schools to bring our thoughts and ideas into their program to reform their issues. The largest long-term goal is getting a solid base of supporters and funding. 

Final product and Dissemination 
	The goal is to publish our research in sociological, educational, and technological forms of media. We also aim to hold training sessions to grow our organization and spread into other schools. The first step is to gain recognition in the community to gain support and spread our message. If we are able to receive this grant, all of our media and public relation pieces will make mention of your organization’s name. Further, the grant would be mentioned in the acknowledgements of any public presentations, seminars, webinars, or scholarly articles we publish. The research that we are collecting is not just valuable to one school in one city, but the feats can be spread to other towns, cities, and states to increase the quality of their education system and help all children find the way to their dream. Other organizations have had success with similar programs, so the track record of the past combined with our new trailblazing ideas will immensely impact the quality of education for the youth of today and, even further, the youth of tomorrow.  
	To ensure our ideals are being held to the highest standard and inclusive of all, there will always be accommodations in place for those who need it. Whether that is special teachers or assistants in place to assist those with special needs, or accessibility software on the computers and technologies we integrate, there will always be the same availability of options for everyone. We can integrate specialized keyboards for the visually impaired and specialized or easily accessible devices and machines for the physically impaired. Assistive technology has been implemented and positively regarded in the education community.  There are assistive tools that assist with listening, reading, math, writing, organization, and more. Whether it be an assistive keyboard, audiobooks, electronic worksheets, or even personal listening systems, our project is ready to take any necessary measure at any cost to equalize the playing field for each student that comes to touch with our program (“Assistive Technology”, Stanberry). 
	Being that a major goal of our project is to refrain from creating socioeconomic bias, it is a goal of our program to keep all of our technologies, classes, and trainings free of charge. The entire premise of this program is to maintain availability for each child that is interested in it. I think another interesting facet of our program is the free learning and training for teachers. Teachers often get the blame for poor learning environments created by the dichotomy of a school, but this is an opportunity for these teachers to find the guidance and ideas they need for their classroom to flourish while also preparing the students, as well as themselves, for the future.
