TOPIC: The education gap in America

Do public schools provide the same level of education to minority groups? 

Are minority groups being granted the same educational opportunities in the fields of math and science? 

What conditions have influenced the education gap in America and what can be done to change it? 

Disparities between differing races has been a large part of the American construct through most of history.
Despite the time and effort of educators, the achievement gap is a prevalent problem in the United States due to socioeconominc and racial background of students, 
weaknesses in the standard education system, and not providing proper programs to elicit success and growth in students. 
The question guiding this project is: are minority students being given the same educational opporunities as non-minority students, particularly in the fields of math,
science, and technology. This project can relate to sociological and political fields of humanities, as well as the scientific discipline. 
The principal activity of this project would be integrating more math, science, and technology opportunities for all students to take advantage of. 
Further, a goal would be to encourage minority students to participate in extracirricular activities relating to an increase in educational programs and workshops.
This program will focus on allowing minority students, especially those with challenging socioeconomic backgrounds, to be able to attend and participate in camps, 
workshops, etc. and equalize their opportunity with non-minority groups to increase their skills with technology and related fields. 
Digital humanities methods that would be useful in this project include: 
Networking: comparing a student's success over time then comparing that to other students of varying economic and racial backgrounds
The expected result of this project would be that minority students that do not have the means to receive the same level of additional math, science, adn technical
training as non-minority students would be able to receive that education and expand their knowledge of their fields of interest.
