Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your Storymap.
Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?
Limits and possibilities of Mapping/ Spatial Analysis
Include links to your data (google sheet) and StoryMap.

First, for assignment 3 I had to collect my data which was through an excel spread sheet.  I collected the data of movement around campus from hour to hour and mark the points that were of significance to my routine.
The next step was to create a story map out of our data fom excel and to do this I had to make a cvs file and import it to a file on the arcgis online website.
Next I had to sign in under the urichmond login to begin the storymap.
I had to create my storymap by going to content and clicking create and clicking to create a web app.
From there, I went to the web application and begin to edit my pop-up points to emphasize certain events. The events that I chose to analyze were football game day events. I started with some of our normal Friday routine and highlighted some of my favorite parts on Saturday. 
During this assignment it has allowed me to realize the significant things in my daily schedule and how they play apart of my life. It is interesting to see how busy my daily routine is.  Certain points on my graph explain certain activities that I part take in during the day and how they align with my extracurricular activities.
The challenges of space and time were an aspect of this assignment that I didn't realize until I recoreded this assignment.  At certain times in my schedule that I didn't have time to do certain events. 
I can't image how a regular students schedule would be mapped out because I feel like they would have alot of free time on their hands comparative to my athletic schedule, but that would definitely vary depending on their level of involvement in other campus activites, jobs, and other commitments. 
I think that this experience was one that some can't relate to because many people are not athletes but the very few that do are atletes themselves.
I think this assignment was good, but only effective as people carefully recorded their routines. I found it hard to recount things throughout the day if I did not record my information when I was doing it. I feel like if I was required to keep my data for a longer time, I would be able to see more trends and become more diligent in the collection of my data. 
I expect that the concentrated topics of space and time were invested in the organaztion of the map. I found it difficult to pin point on the map exactly where I was trying to locate, because not all things are listed online. I feel like this assignment was effective in recognizing a space, so where I clicked, but not nedcessarily the actual space itself.
I feel in the future to lessen the confusion between space and place, technology could be used in the moment. Most phones give the ability to drop a pin where your location is, so that would be a good way to get a more precise cooridante. 
Further, I think more detailed, diligent data collection would be useful in improving this project as a whole. I think possibly if I would have hand recorded data instead of entering it into a spreadsheet at the end of the day, my collection would have been more precise. 
I think that mapping and spatial analysis is very useful in recording changes over time. If data was collected for long periods, then there would be trends and changes viewable. In my personal case, I could see where I allocated my time and which days were more demanding than others. 
Bodenhamer discusses how this data collection goes beyond just geographic location. Initially, I did not understand this thought. With time and research, I see the possibilities of this type of data collection in an array of disciplines. 
This type of data collection can be used in many disciplines in many ways. 
An ability to analyze relationships and characteristics between locations is also possible. This could be useful in sociological research, like high crime rate areas or tracking patterns in shopping, eating, etc, or even recording traffic trends.
There are uses of spatial data ranging from crime to evironment to weather and beyond. It is all dependent on the data collected and how it is utilized. 
Crampton explains that mapping became scientic after World War II, this is supported by what I saw in this project and the assessment by Bodenhamer. He also points out the good and bad in mapping. 
One claim is that maps are useful with infinite ways to present data and learn; others think maps are obsolete and useful for nothing. I think that saying maps are obsolete is a very close minded way of thinking and the possibilites of this technology is being ignored or unrealized. 
The conclusion- This assignment helps identity the things that are not as easy to explain verbally. It is effective in visualizing concepts and clearly communicating that message.
The results from this type of data collection can be used to make relationships, inferences, realize trends, and make decisions.
